 ## Summary
 
  I hadn't used **Unity** for game dev for a long time so I was a bit rusted. As usual I spent too much time refactoring and cleaning the game without actually making proper levels. **Unity DOTS** still seems to be not production ready so I had to make a workaround for **ECS** *(without implementing parallelisation)*. It was also the first time actually using a music for one of my game.
